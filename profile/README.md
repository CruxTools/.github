### What is Crux Garden?
> Crux Garden is a memory architecture. A pattern of mind. It can be implemented in digital systems as a medium of thought that grows, evolves, and connects across time.

In a world of endless feeds and disconnected information, Crux Garden creates a living ecosystem where ideas maintain their origins, evolve meaningfully, and form authentic connections.

This isn't another tool. It's a fundamental reimagining of digital knowledge. Join us in building a medium that remembers.
